===Eclipse does not allow me to create Enums===
Make sure you have configured Maven to be Java 1.5 compliant by configuring the compiler plug-in like so:
{{{
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
	<artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
	<configuration>
		<source>1.5</source>
		<target>1.5</target>
	</configuration>
</plugin>
}}}
Once the POM is configured run these two commands:
* mvn eclipse:clean
* mvn eclipse:eclipse
Then refresh your project and Eclipse should identify your project as valid Java 5 project.
