 ===doc - 30 seconds introduction===
 To give bdoc a testrun on your project place the following configuration in your pom.xml:
{{{
  	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>com.googlecode.bdoc</groupId>
				<artifactId>maven-bdoc-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>0.7.5</version>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
	
	<pluginRepositories>
		<pluginRepository>
			<id>perottobc-release</id>
			<url>http://perottobc-repository.googlecode.com/svn/maven2/releases</url>
		</pluginRepository>
	</pluginRepositories>
}}}
 BDoc is not currently deployd to the central maven repository, so until the 1.0 is released you need a reference to the repo of Mr Per Otto Bergum Christensen. Your could also build the project locally from the source at http://bdoc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk.

 With the above configuration in place run the following command:
{{{
mvn bdoc:doc
}}}
 Your bdoc.html is now generated in the ./target/site/ directory of your project. Check  it out and see what your testcode communicates. 

 ====diff - 30 more seconds====
 BDoc also comes with a diff, so that the developer can see the difference in the bdoc between versions. In order for this to work, bdoc needs to be configured with a _logDirectory_, where it can store snapshot of bdocs. The diff will work on the two latest versions of bdocs, and present the result as an html-report. To enable this feature add the configuration-element shown below:
{{{
	<plugin>
		<groupId>com.googlecode.bdoc</groupId>
		<artifactId>maven-bdoc-plugin</artifactId>
		<version>${maven.bdoc.plugin.version}</version>
		<configuration>
			<logDirectory>bddlog</logDirectory>
		</configuration>
	</plugin>	
}}}
 With the above configuration in place run the following command:
{{{
mvn bdoc:diff
}}}
 The plugin will probably tell you that no diff is found. To see some results do the following:
  * Run _mvn bdoc:doc_ - a bdoc-snaphot will be stored in your _logDirectory_
  * Add, delete og change on or more tests in your project
  * Run _mvn clean bdoc:doc_ - a new bdoc-snaphot will be stored in your _logDirectory_
  * run _mvn bdoc:diff_ again - a diff-report will be generated in your ./target/site/ directory.
