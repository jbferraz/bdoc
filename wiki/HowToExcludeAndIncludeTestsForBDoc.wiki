If there are certain parts of your code you wan't BDoc do exclude you can configure this "Ant-style". In the example below the directory com/googlecode/bdoc/examples/excluded/** with all its testclasses and subdirectories will be excluded. The underlying implementation is done with ant, so any pattern that works in an ant include or exclude should work in BDoc as well.
