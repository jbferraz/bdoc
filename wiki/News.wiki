*Version 0.7.9 is released with TestNG Support without configuration*
 Now every testmethod annontated with Test will be extracted as behaviour. It doesn't matter if the annotation is ~org.junit.Test~ or ~org.testng.annotations.Test~. BDoc will also extract any testmethod starting with 'test', supporting JUnit3.
